Apparently, the 1 gigabyte size limit for public repositories on GitHub Pages is not a hard limit.

It's true that using less than 1 gigabyte for a public repository is ideal, but I can go up to 5 gigabytes if the need presents itself.

To ensure that I can work on this project for a long time, I am no longer making videos for the video page.

Since I'm just making art, music and text, the size limit of 5 gigabytes should take a decade or two to fill up completely.

Now I don't have to worry about size limits for a long ass time!

At most, an individual piece of art or music takes up about 3 megabytes, and text posts usually take up less than 1 megabyte.

I'm pretty much set up for a few years!

All I can say at this rate is...

Thank you GitHub Pages for giving me my Internet freedom back!

Also, if the source code for my website can help you in your current project, please feel free to copy it!

I'm all for sharing!

Keep an eye out for new drawings, digital art, and text posts on my website!

I plan to update this website whenever I make anything new.

Cheers!
