Ding Dong Never Die

Welcome to Ding Dong Never Die! 
This is a website filled with my personal artwork, music, videos, and text. 
It's a convenient way to browse my work and it even comes with collectible stamps! 
It's made out out of HTML5 and CSS3 code.
Yes, the CSS is 100% external.

Over 300 pieces of hand-drawn artwork!
Over 100 songs!
Over 20 digital renders!
And plenty of other pieces of content to browse!

What are you waiting for?

The water's still hot!
