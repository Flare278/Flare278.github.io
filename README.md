Ding Dong Never Die

Welcome to Ding Dong Never Die! 
This is a website filled with my personal artwork, music, videos, and text. 
It's a convenient way to browse my work and it even comes with collectible stamps! 
It's made out out of HTML5 and CSS3 code.
Yes, the CSS is 100% external.

Over 300 pieces of hand-drawn artwork!
Over 100 songs!
Over 20 digital renders!
And plenty of other pieces of content to browse!

What are you waiting for?

The water's still hot!

The only thing you need to access my website is the URL down below!

Thanks to W3schools, developer.mozilla.org, stackoverflow, and Reddit for helping me build this website!

People who have worked on this project:

Flare278.

Honestly, the main reason this project exists is due to the fact that I was tired of having my hopes and dreams of sharing my talents with the world crushed.

Wix is in an unacceptable state, I didn't feel like using WordPress or any other CMS, and I definitely did not want to have any unnecessary java script in my website code.

I wanted full control of how everything worked, looked, and felt.

I also wanted to be able to fix errors easily since I would already know what's under the hood.

I feel that GitHub pages is the only real answer to someone who has a budget of 0$ and has no way of increasing that budget.

If a dumb ass artist like me can learn HTML and CSS, then I'm sure just about anybody could.

(No more excuses. Get off your ass and start living your dreams.)

I started developing this website offline on January 23rd, 2023 and finished it just today on March 7th, 2023.

This website will be updated from time to time with new drawings, music, and digital art.

The YouTube channel will be updated with new videos as well.

This project uses an MIT license and is 100% open source!

On a final note, who the hell actually reads the README.md file?

If you made it to the end, then all I can say is:

Thank you.
