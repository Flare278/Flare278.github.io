Ding Dong Never Die

Welcome to Ding Dong Never Die! This is a website filled with my personal artwork, music, videos, and text. 
It's a convenient way to browse my work and it even comes with collectible stamps! 
It's made out out of HTML5 and CSS3 code and I made sure to keep the CSS external.

The only thing you need to access my website is any modern internet browser, and the URL down below:

https://flare278.github.io/

For those curious, I used Brave browser to look at the HTML offline and check it.

Thanks to W3schools, developer.mozilla.org, stackoverflow, Reddit, and random internet forums I can't remember the name of for helping me build this website!
