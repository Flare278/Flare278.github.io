Honestly, I like making videos and I can't stand limiting myself in terms of creativity, so I'm just going to use Youtube for uploading videos.

The link to the channel will be in the videos page.

All you have to do to reach it is click on the "I want to see more videos!" hyperlink.

Alternatively, you can just use this URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx5nueykTqU3OFzCrbdO67Q

I mostly want to upload gameplay of Super Mario 64, Gamma 64, and Smash Remix.

I don't have a phone number, so the videos will only be 15 minutes long.

I also plan to upload an extended version of "Watch Out For Falling Rocks"

It will be called Super Mario 64 fever.

Thank you for your time, and I'll see you there!
